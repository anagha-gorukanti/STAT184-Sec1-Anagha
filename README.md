# STAT184-HW-Template
 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
 ****Introduction****
This repository is based off of an assignment to excercise my knowledge of Github. 
  ****Implementation:****
  I had to create a new repository based off of a template given in class. Then I installed GitHub Desktop and cloned the repository to my local computer. Afterwards I took previous R code files and pushed them onto the repository.Then I added data files to the data folder and created a .gitignore file. Finally I added a metadata file
 ****Results or Conclusion****
 After completing this assignment I have better grasp of how to use GitHub. This is important because we will be using GitHub for the final project.
